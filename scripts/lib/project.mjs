/**
 * Single source of truth for this project's identity.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the Worker's public URL used to be hard-coded in four places
 * (the refresh workflow, the DevTools snippet, and two tests) and its name in
 * eight more. Moving to a different Cloudflare account changes the URL, because
 * the `*.workers.dev` subdomain belongs to the account — so every one of those
 * copies would have to be found and edited by hand, and a missed one fails
 * silently: the tests keep passing against the old deployment while the workflow
 * polls a URL that no longer exists.
 *
 * Now `project.json` is the only place these values live. `scripts/deploy.mjs`
 * writes the real URL back after a successful deploy, and everything else reads
 * it from here.
 *
 *   import { loadProject, saveProject, sourceOf } from './lib/project.mjs';
